 💚 $GIVE – Born from the Spirit of Compassion

$GIVE is not just a cryptocurrency. It was born from real stories. From seeing people around us struggle silently. From witnessing communities that are full of potential, but forgotten. From feeling the urge to do something — even if it's small.

This token was inspired by the people around us who are often overlooked.  
People who simply need a helping hand, a bit of hope, or a moment of kindness to keep going.

## ✨ Why $GIVE?

Because Web3 shouldn't only be about making money. It should also be about making meaning.

$GIVE is here to:
- Bring attention to communities that deserve better
- Encourage acts of giving — no matter how small
- Use the power of crypto to fuel real human kindness

## 🌍 Our Mission

We believe that kindness is contagious. That one generous act can inspire thousands. And that technology, when used with purpose, can heal instead of harm.

## 🔗 A Movement You Can Join

We’re not building hype. We’re building heart.  
If you believe Web3 should be more human, more hopeful — then $GIVE is for you.

**Let’s spread giving. Let’s turn compassion into a currency.**

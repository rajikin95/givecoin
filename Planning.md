# ðŸ§  Initial Planning of $GIVE Token

Before creating this token, we started with a simple question:  
**"What if Web3 wasn't just about profit, but also about giving?"**

$GIVE was born from empathy â€” for those who struggle every day, whether we see them around us or on social media from all over the world.  
We realized that blockchain technology holds great potential not just to generate wealth, but to spread kindness in a real and meaningful way.

## ðŸŽ¯ Focus Areas During Early Planning

- **Core Mission:** Using the power of community and Web3 to help others.  
- **Core Values:** Transparency, solidarity, and real action.  
- **Visual Identity:** A design that reflects "kindness", using visual elements like giving hands, hearts, and the color green for life.  
- **Platform:** Choosing Pump.fun as our launchpad for its speed and strong community support.  
- **Resources:** Designing a realistic roadmap that is achievable together with the community.

This token is not just a project â€” it's a **movement**.  
A movement to turn crypto into a tool for giving, not just speculation. ðŸ’š
